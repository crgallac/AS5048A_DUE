# AS5048A_DUE
This is an API I augmented from the wrok of ZoetropeLabs. I modified it to work with the Arduino DUE microcontroller SerialUSB protocol which takes advantage of the Native USB Host on the ARM M3 board. I also updated the respective timing clocks to fit within the 4-5 MHz range prescribed by the AS5048a datasheet.
